Welcome to my talk about concentrations of substances commonly abused and their metabolites in wastewater during a college football game! 

For this talk, you can look at the [slides](talk.html), as well as the accompanying [handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbQRyxtki5YqpGTdRt_AGXJEDOjFjXBsGvQqgYc2dr0/edit?usp=sharing). The handout should contain all of the major information you might need to have on hand as you listen to the talk. For example, all of the key figures I will base my conclusions on are included in the handout.

### During the talk
While you are welcome to ask any questions during the presentation, you may feel more comfortable submitting anonymous questions, which I will look at after the presentation is done. You can ask those questions [here](https://PollEv.com/free_text_polls/a8cDmj14lpNxLbI91adiz/respond).

I will also be asking you to generate some ideas or criticisms of the study throughout the lecture. I will provide links in the slides that will go to polleverywhere questions.

### After the talk
The results I discussed can be found in a peer-reviewed manuscript [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969720374945).
