Welcome to my talk about concentrations of substances commonly abused and their metabolites in wastewater during a college football game! 

For this talk, you can look at the [slides](talk.html), as well as the accompanying [handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mbQRyxtki5YqpGTdRt_AGXJEDOjFjXBsGvQqgYc2dr0/edit?usp=sharing). The handout should contain all of the major information you might need to have on hand as you listen to the talk. For example, all of the key figures I will base my conclusions on are included in the handout.

### During the talk

I will also be asking you to generate some ideas about what the limitations of this study were. When the time comes, you can provide your input in-person.

### After the talk
The results I discussed can be found in a peer-reviewed manuscript [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969720374945).
