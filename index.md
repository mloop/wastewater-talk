Welcome to my talk about concentrations of substances commonly abused and their metabolites in wastewater during a college football game. 

For this talk, you can look at the slides, as well as the accompanying handout. The handout should contain all of the major information you might need to have on hand as you listen to the talk. For example, all of the key figures I will base my conclusions on are included in the handout.

During the talk
If you have a question, you can fill out the poll here. I will review all of the questions at the end of the talk, time-permitting.

I will also be asking you to generate some ideas about what the limitations of this study were. When the time comes, you can submit what you think the limitations were here.

After the talk
The results I discussed can be found in a peer-reviewed manuscripts [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969720374945).
