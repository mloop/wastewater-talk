# Mass gatherings and substance use

- Could provide a window into community substance use
- A particular community could have a certain profile of substance use, leading to targeted interventions

---

# The problem

- How do we measure something that's (possibly) illegal to have?
- What if we don't have the resources our particular community needs?
- We should care for the health problems of our particular community (i.e., precision public health)

# Measure the drug concentrations

- Used a Teledyne ISCO sampler at 2 man holes and 1 pumping station
- Sampling began 1 hour before kick-off to 30 minutes after the game ended
- Grab samples of 300 mL untreated wastewater collected every 30 minutes
